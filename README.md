# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, designed to analyze patient health patterns and survival factors.  
The dashboard provides key insights into survival rates, age group effects, biomarker influence, and the impact of lifestyle & medical conditions.

## 🔍 Key Metrics
| Metric | Value | Insight |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Survival Rate** | **67.89%** | Majority of patients survived treatment/monitoring. |
| **Avg. Age of Survivors** | **58.76 years** | Mid-to-late adulthood patients show higher resilience. |
| **Total Survivors** | **203 patients** | Indicates positive treatment outcomes overall. |
| **Total Deaths** | **96 patients** | Provides critical severity benchmark. |

## 🧠 Major Insights

### 1. **Age Group Patterns**
- Highest survival observed in **age groups 61–70 and 51–60**.
- Survival significantly decreases among patients **above 70**.

### 2. **Biomarkers Impact**
- **Serum Creatinine** levels: Higher levels correlate with **lower survival**.
- **Ejection Fraction**: Higher ejection fraction values are associated with **better survival chances**.

### 3. **Lifestyle & Medical Risk Factors**
Risk factors evaluated across age groups include:
- Smoking
- High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)
- Diabetes
- Anemia

Older groups tend to show **multiple overlapping risk factors**, increasing fatality likelihood.
